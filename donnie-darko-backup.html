    <h2>Foreword</h2>
    <p>I would like to thank the Sisters of the Saint John Chapter in Alexandria, Virginia for their support in my decision.</p>
    <p>By the grace of God, they are:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Sister Eleanor Lewis</li>
      <li>Sister Francesca Godard</li>
      <li>Sister Helen Davis</li>
      <li>Sister Catherine Arnold</li>
      <li>Sister Mary Lee Pond</li>
      <li>Sister Virginia Wessex</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The intent of this book is for it to be used as a simple and direct guide in a time of great danger.</p>
    <p>I pray that this is purely a work of fiction.</p>
    <p>If it is not, then I pray for you, the reader of this book.</p>
    <p>If I am still alive when the events foretold in these pages occur, then I hope that you will find me before it is too late.</p>

      <h2>1. THE TANGENT UNIVERSE</h2>
      <p>The Primary Universe is fraught with great peril. War, plague, famine and natural disaster are common.</p>
      <p>Death comes to us all.</p>
      <p>The Fourth Dimension of Time is a stable construct, though it is not impenetrable.</p>
      <p>Incidents when the fabric of the Fourth Dimension becomes corrupted are incredibly rare.</p>
      <p>If a Tangent Universe occurs, it will be highly unstable, sustaining itself for no longer than several weeks.</p>
      <p>Eventually it will collapse upon itself, forming a black hole within the Primary Universe capable of destroying all existence.</p>
    </section>

      <h2>2. THE ARTIFACT AND THE LIVING</h2>
      <p>When a Tangent Universe occurs, those living nearest to the Vortex will find themselves at the epicenter of a dangerous new world.</p>
      <p>Artifacts provide the first sign that a Tangent Universe has occured.</p>
      <p>If an Artifact occurs, the Living will retrieve it with great interest and curiosity.</p>
      <p>Artifacts are formed from metal, such as an Arrowhead from an ancient Mayan civilization, or a Metal Sword from Medieval Europe.</p>
      <p>Artifacts returned to the Primary Universe are often linked in religious iconography, as their appearance on Earth seems to defy logical explanation.</p>
      <p>Divine Intervention is deemed to be the only logical conclusion for the appearance of the artifact.</p>

      <h2>3. WATER AND METAL</h2>
      <p>Water and Metal are the key elements of Time Travel.</p>
      <p>Water is the barrier element for the construction of Time Portals used as gateways between universes at the Tangent Vortex.</p>
      <p>Metal is the transitional element for the construction of Artefact Vessels.</p>

      <h2>4. DREAMS</h2>
      <p>When the Manipulated awaken from their Journey into the Tangent Universe, they are often haunted by the experience in their dreams.</p>
      <p>Many of them will not remember.</p>
      <p>Those who do remember the journey are often overcome with profound remorse for the regretful actions buried within their dreams,</p>
      <p>the only physical evidence buried within the artifact itself; all that remains from the lost world.</p>
      <p>Ancient myth tells us of the Mayan Warrior killed by an arrowhead that had fallen from a cliff, where there was no army, no enemy to be found.</p>
      <p>We are told of the Medieval Knight mysteriously impaled by the sword he had not yet built.</p>
      <p>We are told that these things occur for a reason.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h2>5. THE LIVING RECEIVER</h2>
      <p>The Living Receiver is chosen to guide the Artifact into position for its journey back to the Primary Universe.</p>
      <p>No one knows how or why a receiver will be chosen.</p>
      <p>The Living Receiver is often blessed with Fourth Dimensional Powers.</p>
      <p>These include increased strength, telekinesis, mind control, and the ability to conjure fire and water.</p>
      <p>The Living Receiver is often tormented by terrifying dreams, visions and auditory hallucinations during his time within the Tangent Universe.</p>
      <p>Those surrounding the Living Receiver, known as the Manipulated, will fear him and try to destroy him.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h2>6. THE MANIPULATED DEAD</h2>
      <p>The Manipulated Dead are more powerful than the Living Receiver.</p>
      <p>If a person dies within the Tangent Universe, they are able to contact the Living Receiver through the Fourth Dimensional Construct.</p>
      <p>The Fourth Dimensional Construct is made of Water.</p>
      <p>The Manipulated Dead will manipulate the Living Receiver using the Fourth Dimensional Construct.</p>
      <p>The Manipulated Dead will often set an Ensurance Trap for the Living Receiver to ensure that the Artifact is returned safely to the Primary Universe.</p>
      <p>If the Ensurance Trap is successful, the Living Receiver is left with no choice but to use his Fourth Dimensional</p>
      <p>Power to send the Artifact back in time into the Primary Universe before the Black Hole collapses upon itself.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h2>7. THE MANIPULATED LIVING</h2>
      <p>The Manipulated Living are often the close friends and neighbours of the Living Receiver.</p>
      <p>They are prone to irrational, bazaar, and often violent behaviour.</p>
      <p>This is the unfortunate result of their task, which is to assist the Living Receiver in returning the Artifact to the Primary Universe.</p>
      <p>The Manipulated Living will do anything to save themselves from Oblivion.</p>
